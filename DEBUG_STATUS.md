# Current Debug Status

## Issues to Verify Before Continuing

### 1. Overlay Rendering (Stats Display)
- **Status**: Code exists but may not be displaying
- **Test**: Press 'H' to toggle stats - should show FPS, render mode, etc.
- **Files**: `renderer_gl_overlay_methods.go`, `overlay/renderer_gl_stats.go`

### 2. Age Visualization (Mode 8)
- **Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Expected**: Should show crust age with color gradient
- **Action**: Skip for now, not critical for plate tectonics

### 3. Plate Motion Verification
- **Status**: NEEDS VERIFICATION
- **Test Method**:
  1. Run simulation for 5+ minutes
  2. Watch continents - they should drift slowly eastward
  3. Ocean/continent boundaries should change over time
  4. Velocity mode (2) should show arrows/colors indicating movement
  5. Stress mode (5) should show stress at plate boundaries

## Quick Tests to Run

1. **Render Modes Test**:
   - Press 1-7, each should show different visualization
   - Mode 1: Material (blue ocean, green land)
   - Mode 2: Velocity (should show movement)
   - Mode 3: Temperature 
   - Mode 4: Plates (different colors per plate)
   - Mode 5: Stress (red at boundaries)
   - Mode 6: Sub-position
   - Mode 7: Elevation (topographic colors)

2. **Movement Test**:
   - In velocity mode (2), look for any colored areas
   - Even slow movement should show some color
   - If all dark blue, plates aren't moving

3. **Console Output**:
   - Should see periodic updates about:
     - Sea level changes
     - Advection movements
     - Plate deformation (if enabled)

## Known Working Features
- ✅ Coordinate system (poles at top/bottom)
- ✅ Multiple render modes
- ✅ Elevation visualization
- ✅ Water conservation
- ✅ No more continent blinking
- ✅ VelNorth/VelEast naming

## Potential Issues
- Initial velocities might be too low
- Plate identification might not be working
- Time step might be too small
