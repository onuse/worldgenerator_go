## Next Steps (Prioritized)

3. **User Interface** - ImGui integration for real-time parameter control
4. **Surface Processes** - Erosion, sedimentation, river formation
5. **Climate System** - Temperature distribution, ice caps, weather

## Technical Notes

### Why This Order?
1. **Foundation First**: Can't visualize without proper data access
2. **Incremental Complexity**: Start with surface, add volume later
3. **Visual Feedback**: Each step produces visible results
4. **Performance Awareness**: Optimize as we go, not after
5. **User Value**: Deliver useful features early

### Current Implementation Notes
- âœ… Both texture-based and SSBO-based rendering work
- âœ… Volume rendering allows seeing inside the planet
- âœ… Cross-sections work in all modes
- âœ… Ocean/continent dithering fixed (see CLAUDE.md)
- âœ… GPU compute shaders for physics (temperature diffusion, convection)
- âœ… Persistent mapped buffers for zero-copy GPU operations
- âœ… 150+ FPS performance achieved

### Known Limitations
- Age data not yet stored in voxels
- Velocity visualization is basic (no arrows/streamlines)
- Plate tectonics has no actual dynamics (static plates only)
- No plate boundary interactions or geological processes

### Performance Targets
- 60+ FPS with full planet visualization
- <16ms frame time with ray marching
- Minimal CPU-GPU transfer
- Real-time response to parameter changes

## Controls

### Rendering Modes
- **V** - Toggle volume rendering (see inside the planet)
- **S** - Toggle SSBO mode (alternative data access)
- **1-4** - Visualization modes (material/temperature/velocity/age)

### Cross-Sections
- **X/Y/Z** - Toggle cross-section on respective axis

### Volume Rendering
- **+/-** - Adjust opacity (when in volume mode)
- **[/]** - Adjust step size (quality vs performance)

### Camera
- **Mouse drag** - Rotate view
- **Scroll** - Zoom in/out
