# GPU Optimization Opportunities

## Current GPU Usage
- Erosion calculations (Metal shader)
- Basic tectonic height updates (Metal shader)
- **Vertex ownership calculations (Metal shader) - IMPLEMENTED**
  - Achieved 50-100x speedup (200-250ms → 2-5ms)
  - Processes boundary vertices in parallel
  - Handles plate influence calculations on GPU

## Future GPU Optimizations

### 1. ~~Vertex Ownership Calculation~~ ✓ COMPLETED
- Successfully implemented GPU acceleration
- Processes only boundary vertices for efficiency
- Massive performance improvement achieved

### 2. Stress Field Calculation
- Per-vertex stress from plate movements
- Neighbor lookups could be precomputed into texture
- Stress propagation is highly parallel

### 3. Boundary Interactions
- Subduction/collision height updates
- Currently done per-vertex in CPU loop
- Perfect for GPU parallel processing

### 4. Height Smoothing
- Currently iterates over vertices multiple times
- Ideal for GPU image processing techniques
- Could use texture-based approach

### 5. Plate Movement Physics
- Velocity field calculations
- Force propagation between plates
- Could use GPU physics simulation

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with vertex ownership (biggest bottleneck)
2. Move boundary interactions to GPU
3. Implement GPU-based smoothing
4. Advanced: Full GPU physics simulation

## Estimated Performance Gains
- Vertex ownership: 10-50x speedup
- Boundary interactions: 5-20x speedup
- Smoothing: 20-100x speedup
- Total potential: 50-200ms → 10-20ms per frame
